Disclaimer
==========

This program lets you download tons of images from Google.
Please do not download or use any image that violates its copyright terms.
Google Images is a search engine that merely indexes images and allows you to find them.
It does NOT produce its own images and, as such, it doesn't own copyright on any of them.
The original creators of the images own the copyrights.

Images published in the United States are automatically copyrighted by their owners,
even if they do not explicitly carry a copyright warning.
You may not reproduce copyright images without their owner's permission,
except in "fair use" cases,
or you could risk running into lawyer's warnings, cease-and-desist letters, and copyright suits.
Please be very careful before its usage! Use this script/code only for educational purposes.

2020/3/20 현재 사용법
====================
- 구글 이미지 다운로드에 대한 큰 변화로 인해, 자동 다운로드 지원되지 않음. 
- 구글은 클릭을 해야만, 이미지에 대한 url이 나타나도록 자바스크립트를 추가해 놓은 것으로 보임. => 추가 해결방법이 나올 수 있을 듯.
- 본 코드는 다음과 같이 bing을 이용하여 실행될 수 있음. 

```
   > python bing_scraper.py --limit 10 --serarch '노무현' 
```
